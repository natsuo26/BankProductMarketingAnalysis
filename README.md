# **Bank Product Marketing Analysis**

## *This is a repository for my mini-project, Bank Product Market Analysis.*


### Project: Bank Product Marketing Analysis

In this project we are trying to find the best strategies to improve for the next
marketing campaign. How can the financial institution have a greater effectiveness for
future marketing campaigns? In order to answer this, we must analyse the last
marketing campaign the bank performed and identify the patterns that will help us find
conclusions in order to develop future strategies.

This analysis will help the business to deploy proper resources on right areas to
maximise the output from their resources. Reduce the cost on wasteful
advertisements and client outreach. We can pinpoint factors exactly what affects a
product’s probability of being subscribed in a marketing campaign.

The used dataset pulled from Kaggle is the classic marketing bank dataset uploaded
originally in the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset gives us information
about a marketing campaign of a financial institution.
